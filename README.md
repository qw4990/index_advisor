# TiDB Index Advisor (Beta)

## Introduction

Index selection is an important part of database performance tuning. However, it is a complex and time-consuming task.
Even experienced experts can hardly guarantee to find the best index scheme accurately and quickly when facing a complex
workload containing dozens or even hundreds of tables and thousands of SQLs.

TiDB Index Advisor (beta) is a command-line tool that can automatically recommend indexes based on the workload,
statistics, and execution plan
cost in TiDB, which can greatly reduce the workload of index maintenance in performance tuning.

## How it works

Index Advisor is based on the Hypo Index feature of TiDB. This feature allows users to create and maintain a series of
hypothetical indexes in the optimizer. These indexes are only maintained in the optimizer and will not be actually
created, so the overhead is very low. Combined with the `Explain` statement, you can evaluate the impact of an index on
the query plan, and then determine whether the index is valuable.

![overview.png](doc/overview.png)

The working principle of Index Advisor is as follows, which can be roughly divided into three steps:

1. Index Advisor collects workload-related table structures, statistics, and related queries from the system tables of
   the TiDB instance.
2. Index Advisor generates a series of candidate indexes based on the collected information, and uses Hypo Index to
   create these indexes.
3. Index Advisor uses `Explain` to evaluate the value of these indexes (whether they can reduce some queries' plan
   costs) and make recommendations.

In our experiments, it can bring significant performance improvement on these workloads (see [Evaluation](#evaluation)):

## How to use it

TiDB Index Advisor provides two ways to use it, offline mode and online mode:

- In online mode, you don’t need to prepare any data. Index Advisor will directly access your TiDB instance for index
  analysis and recommendation. **During this period, it will read some system table information and create some Hypo
  Indexes, but it will not modify the data**.
- In offline mode, Index Advisor will not directly access your TiDB instance. It will start a TiDB instance locally,
  import the data you provide, and then perform index analysis and recommendation.

Generally speaking:

- Online mode is easier to use and more secure, since you don't have to export any data from you cluster;
- Offline mode is more flexible, but you need to prepare some data in advance.

![online_offline_mode.png](doc/online_offline_mode.png)

### Installation

If you are going to use the offline-mode, you need to install [TiUP](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/tiup-overview)
first. Please use the following command to install [TiUP](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/tiup-overview):

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/install.sh | sh
```

Currently, to use this tool, you have to build it from the source code (we'll prepare a binary version soon):

```shell
# install golang on your machine first
> git clone https://github.com/qw4990/index_advisor.git
> cd index_advisor; go build;
```

### Online Mode

In online mode, Index Advisor will directly access your TiDB instance, so you need to ensure the following conditions:

- The TiDB version needs to be equal or higher than v7.3, so that the `Hypo Index` feature can be used. (See workaround
  on [FAQs](#error-your-tidb-version-does-not-support-hypothetical-index-feature) if you are using a lower version of
  TiDB)
- Index Advisor will read the query information from `Statement Summary` (if the query file is not manually specified),
  so you need to ensure that the `Statement Summary` feature has been enabled and the `tidb_redact_log` feature has been
  disabled, otherwise the query cannot be obtained from it.

You can use `index_advisor precheck --dsn='root:@tcp(127.0.0.1:4000)'` to check whether your cluster can meet the above
conditions.

The following is an example of using online mode:

```
index_advisor advise-online --dsn='root:@tcp(127.0.0.1:4000)' \
--max-num-indexes=5 \
--output='./data/advise_output'
```

The meaning of each parameter is as follows:

- `dsn`: the DSN of the TiDB instance.
- `max-num-indexes`: the maximum number of recommended indexes, default `5`.
- `output`: the path to save the output result, optional; if it is empty, it will be printed directly on the terminal.

Below are some optional parameters to help you filter queries:

- `query-schemas`: the schema names of queries to be analyzed, separated by commas, optional, e.g. `db1,db2`.
- `query-exec-time-threshold`: the threshold of query execution time(in milliseconds), e.g. `300`, queries that are
  running longer than or equal to this threshold will be considered.
- `query-exec-count-threshold`: the threshold of query execution count, e.g. `20`, queries that are executed more than
  or equal to this threshold will be considered.
- `query-path`: use this parameter to specify queries manually, it's the path of the query file (optional, if it is
  specified, the advisor will not read queries from `Statement Summary`), which can be a single file (such
  as [`examples/tpch_example2/queries.sql`](examples/tpch_example2/queries.sql)) or a folder (such
  as [`examples/tpch_example1/queries`](examples/tpch_example1/queries)).

See more examples on [Usages](#usages).

### Offline Mode

Offline mode requires the following data:

- Query file (or folder): can be in the form of a single file or a folder.
    - Folder: such as [`examples/tpch_example1/queries`](examples/tpch_example1/queries), a folder, each file inside is
      a query.
    - Single file: such as [`examples/tpch_example2/queries.sql`](examples/tpch_example2/queries.sql), which contains
      multiple query statements separated by semicolons.
- Schema information file: such as [`examples/tpch_example1/schema.sql`](examples/tpch_example1/schema.sql), which
  contains the original `create-table` statement separated by semicolons.
- Statistics information folder: such as [`examples/tpch_example1/stats`](examples/tpch_example1/stats), a folder, which
  stores the statistics information files of related tables. Each statistics information file should be in JSON format
  and can be downloaded
  through [the TiDB statistics information dump](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/statistics#export-statistics).

After preparing the above files, you can directly use Index Advisor for index recommendation, such as:

```shell
index_advisor advise-offline --tidb-version=v7.3.0 \
--query-path=examples/tpch_example1/queries \
--schema-path=examples/tpch_example1/schema.sql \
--stats-path=examples/tpch_example1/stats \
--max-num-indexes=5 \
--output='./data/advise_output'
```

The meaning of each parameter is as follows:

- `tidb-version`: the TiDB version used. Index Advisor will start an instance of this version of TiDB locally.
- `query-path`: the path of the query file, which can be a single file (such
  as [`examples/tpch_example2/queries.sql`](examples/tpch_example2/queries.sql)) or a folder (such
  as [`examples/tpch_example1/queries`](examples/tpch_example1/queries)).
- `schema-path`: the path of the schema information file (such
  as [`examples/tpch_example1/schema.sql`](examples/tpch_example1/schema.sql)).
- `stats-path`: the path of the statistics information folder (such
  as [`examples/tpch_example1/stats`](examples/tpch_example1/stats)).
- `max-num-indexes`: the maximum number of recommended indexes, default `5`.
- `output`: the path to save the output result, optional; if it is empty, it will be printed directly on the terminal.

To simplify, you can also put all required files on the same directory, and then just
use `--dir-path=examples/tpch_example1`.

### Output

The output of Index Advisor is a folder (such as [`examples/tpch_example1/output`](examples/tpch_example1/output)),
which contains the following files:

- `summary.txt`: the summary result, which contains recommended indexes and expected benefits.
- `ddl.sql`: DDL of all recommended indexes.
- `q*.txt`: expected benefit of each query in your workload, which contains the plan and plan cost before and after
  creating these recommended indexes.

Below is an example of [`examples/tpch_example1/output/summary.txt`](examples/tpch_example1/output/summary.txt):

```
Total Queries in the workload: 21
Total number of indexes: 5
  CREATE INDEX idx_l_partkey_l_quantity_l_shipmode ON tpch.lineitem (l_partkey, l_quantity, l_shipmode);
  CREATE INDEX idx_l_partkey_l_shipdate_l_shipmode ON tpch.lineitem (l_partkey, l_shipdate, l_shipmode);
  CREATE INDEX idx_l_suppkey_l_shipdate ON tpch.lineitem (l_suppkey, l_shipdate);
  CREATE INDEX idx_o_custkey_o_orderdate_o_totalprice ON tpch.orders (o_custkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice);
  CREATE INDEX idx_ps_suppkey_ps_supplycost ON tpch.partsupp (ps_suppkey, ps_supplycost);
Total original workload cost: 1.37E+10
Total optimized workload cost: 1.02E+10
Total cost reduction ratio: 25.22%
Top 10 queries with the most cost reduction ratio:
  Alias: q22, Cost Reduction Ratio: 1.97E+08->4.30E+06(0.02)
  Alias: q19, Cost Reduction Ratio: 2.89E+08->1.20E+07(0.04)
  Alias: q20, Cost Reduction Ratio: 3.40E+08->4.39E+07(0.13)
...
```

Above is the summary of the recommendation, which contains the recommended indexes, the expected benefits to the entire
workload, and the expected benefits of the top 5 queries.

### Restrictions and Explanations

Some explanations:

- We'll integrate this tool into our cloud platform in the future to make it more convenient to use on cloud.
- This tool can work for both new systems (no indexes) and existing systems. For existing systems, it will not recommend
  indexes that already exist.
- Usually, this tool takes a few minutes to finish the recommendation.
- There is another alternative tool called [index-insight](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/index-insight) that works
  as a diagnostic tool for index recommendation in TiDB Clinic, here are the differences:
    - [index-insight](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/index-insight) is only for cloud, while this tool can work for
      both on-premise and cloud.
    - [index-insight](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/index-insight) can only recommend indexes for a single query,
      while this tool can recommend indexes for a
      workload.
    - [index-insight](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/index-insight) works as a diagnostic tool triggered by slow
      queries, while this is a physical database design tool.

Below are some restrictions:

- It cannot recommend primary keys.
- The maximum number of indexes to recommend at a time is `20`, and the maximum index width is `5`, otherwise it will take too long.
- If the target workload is too simple, it may not recommend the `max-num-indexes` indexes.
- Restrictions of Online Mode:
    - The TiDB Version must be equal or larger than `v7.3`. (see workaround
      on [FAQs](#error-your-tidb-version-does-not-support-hypothetical-index-feature)
    - The `tidb_redact_log` must be set to `false`.

### Export workload information using `workload-export`

You can use the command `workload-export` to export workload info required by offline-mode from your cluster, here is an example:

```shell
./index_advisor workload-export \
--dsn='root:@tcp(127.0.0.1:4000)/test' \
--status_address='http://127.0.0.1:10080' \
--output=./examples/workload_export_output
```

The tool will read all queries and table schemas from the TiDB specified by `DSN` and export all table statistics through `status_address` (see [stats export on TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/statistics#import-and-export-statistics) for more details).

Here is its [output](examples/workload_export_output). And then you can use the offline mode directly:

```shell
./index_advisor advise-offline --tidb-version=nightly \
--dir-path=./examples/workload_export_output \
--max-num-indexes=2 \
--output=./examples/workload_export_output/output
```

And here is the [advisor result](examples/workload_export_output/output).

## Evaluation

We use multiple workloads to evaluate the Index Advisor.

### TPC-H

We use TPC-H-1G to evalute it, which contains 8 tables, 21 queries (excluding q15), and let Index Advisor recommend 5
indexes for these queries:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_l_partkey_l_quantity_l_shipmode ON tpch.lineitem (l_partkey, l_quantity, l_shipmode);
CREATE INDEX idx_l_partkey_l_shipdate ON tpch.lineitem (l_partkey, l_shipdate);
CREATE INDEX idx_l_suppkey_l_shipdate ON tpch.lineitem (l_suppkey, l_shipdate);
CREATE INDEX idx_o_custkey_o_orderdate_o_totalprice ON tpch.orders (o_custkey, o_orderdate, o_totalprice);
CREATE INDEX idx_ps_suppkey_ps_supplycost ON tpch.partsupp (ps_suppkey, ps_supplycost);
```

After creating these indexes, the execution time of all queries is reduced from `17.143s` to `14.373s`, and the
execution time is reduced by `-16%`:

![tpch_total](doc/evaluation_tpch_1g_total.png)

The following are several queries with significant improvement:

![tpch_query](doc/evaluation_tpch_1g_query.png)

In `q19`, after creating these indexes, it can avoid the full table scan of the large table `lineitem`, and reduce the
execution time from `557ms` to `8.75ms`.

### JOB

We use JOB to evaluate it, which contains x tables, x queries, and let Index Advisor recommend 10 indexes for these
queries:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_movie_id_person_id ON imdbload.cast_info (movie_id, person_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_person_id ON imdbload.cast_info (person_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_role_id ON imdbload.cast_info (role_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_company_type_id ON imdbload.movie_companies (company_type_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_movie_id_company_id_company_type_id ON imdbload.movie_companies (movie_id, company_id, company_type_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_info_type_id ON imdbload.movie_info (info_type_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_movie_id_info_type_id ON imdbload.movie_info (movie_id, info_type_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_movie_id_info_type_id ON imdbload.movie_info_idx (movie_id, info_type_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_keyword_id_movie_id ON imdbload.movie_keyword (keyword_id, movie_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_movie_id_keyword_id ON imdbload.movie_keyword (movie_id, keyword_id);
```

After creating these indexes, the execution time of all queries is reduced from `225s` to `120s`, and the execution time
is reduced by `-46%`:

![job_total](doc/evaluation_job_total.png)

The following are several queries with significant improvement:

![job_query](doc/evaluation_job_query.png)

In some queries, through using `IndexJoin` to access the large table `cast_info` and `movie_info`, the execution time is
obviously reduced.

### TPC-DS

In TPC-DS 1G test, we use 61 queries (excluding queries that TiDB does not support well), and let Index Advisor
recommend 10 indexes:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_cs_call_center_sk ON tpcds.catalog_sales (cs_call_center_sk);
CREATE INDEX idx_cs_sold_date_sk ON tpcds.catalog_sales (cs_sold_date_sk);
CREATE INDEX idx_ca_city ON tpcds.customer_address (ca_city);
CREATE INDEX idx_ca_state_ca_country_ca_city ON tpcds.customer_address (ca_state, ca_country, ca_city);
CREATE INDEX idx_d_year_d_moy_d_qoy ON tpcds.date_dim (d_year, d_moy, d_qoy);
CREATE INDEX idx_i_category_i_brand_i_class ON tpcds.item (i_category, i_brand, i_class);
CREATE INDEX idx_ss_sold_date_sk_ss_net_profit ON tpcds.store_sales (ss_sold_date_sk, ss_net_profit);
CREATE INDEX idx_ss_sold_time_sk ON tpcds.store_sales (ss_sold_time_sk);
CREATE INDEX idx_t_hour ON tpcds.time_dim (t_hour);
CREATE INDEX idx_ws_sold_date_sk_ws_net_profit ON tpcds.web_sales (ws_sold_date_sk, ws_net_profit)
```

After creating these indexes, the execution time is reduced by `-10%`:

![tpcds_total](doc/evaluation_tpcds_1g_total.png)

Below are several queries with significant improvement:

![tpcds_query](doc/evaluation_tpcds_1g_query.png)

### Web3Bench

The advisor recommends 7 indexes for this workload:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_block_number ON ethereum.receipts (block_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_from_address_block_number_token_address ON ethereum.token_transfers (from_address, block_number, token_address);
CREATE INDEX idx_token_address ON ethereum.token_transfers (token_address);
CREATE INDEX idx_block_number ON ethereum.transactions (block_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_from_address ON ethereum.transactions (from_address);
CREATE INDEX idx_hash ON ethereum.transactions (hash);
CREATE INDEX idx_to_address_block_timestamp_value ON ethereum.transactions (to_address, block_timestamp, `value`);
```

After creating these indexes, the total workload execution time is reduced by `-85%`:

![web3bench_total](doc/evaluation_web3bench_total.png)

Below are several queries with significant improvement:

![web3bench_query](doc/evaluation_web3bench_query.png)

### A Web3 Customer Workload

After creating a few recommended indexes, the total workload plan cost is reduced by `-75%`:

![web3_customer_total](doc/evaluation_web3_customer_total.png)

Below are several queries with significant improvement:

![web3_customer_query](doc/evaluation_web3_customer_query.png)

## Usages

### Specify query file manually on online-mode

```bash
index_advisor advise-online --dsn='root:@tcp(127.0.0.1:4000)\
--max-num-indexes=5 \
--query-path=examples/tpch_example1/queries \
--output='./data/advise_output'
```

### Use query filter parameters on online-mode

In the example below, only consider queries that run more than 1 second on `DB1`:

```bash
index_advisor advise-online --dsn='root:@tcp(127.0.0.1:4000)\
--max-num-indexes=5 \
--query-schemas='DB1' \
--query-exec-time-threshold=1000 \
--output='./data/advise_output'
```

## FAQs

### Error `your TiDB version does not support hypothetical index feature`

This error occurs when the TiDB version is too low, and the hypothetical index feature is not supported. Please make
sure your TiDB version is equal or large equal to `v7.3`.

A workaround is to use `workload-export` to load workload information from your online cluster, and then use `offline-mode` with the latest version of TiDB(`-tidb-version='nightly'`), the result is also of
high reference value.

See an example in [workload-export section](#export-workload-information-using-workload-export).

### Error `table 'db.t' doesn't exist` on offline-mode

This error is usually caused by the lack of database name in `schema-path`, you can manually add `Use DB`
and `Create DB` statements in the schema file:

```sql
CREATE
DATABASE tpch;
USE
tpch;
CREATE TABLE `customer`
(
    ...
);
...
```

## Future Plans

- Support index deletion recommendation
- Integrate this tool with `TiUP` and `TiDB Cloud`
